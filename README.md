# Time is Money (TIM) calculator #

This is a software implementation of the [Time is Money Meeting Cost Calculator](http://thedilbertstore.com/products/84531-time-is-money-meeting-cost-calculator).

It was written using C# targetting WinForms/.NET 2.0, around June 2010.

It features a couple of minor improvements over the hardware version, namely that it supports much higher hourly rates (`> 995$/hr`) and number of participants (`> 99`).  It also doesn't require batteries. :)
